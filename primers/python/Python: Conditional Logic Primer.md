# Conditional Logic

## If Statements
If statements are the most foundational way to make decisions in Python.

1. Create new Repl called **Conditional Logic Primers**
1. Enter the following source code:

```python
purchased = False

if purchased:
    print("Item was purchased")
```

## If-Else Statements

## If-Elif-Else Statements

## Match Statements
Recall `switch` statements in the C programming language were a convenient way to avoid countless `else if` blocks. Python doesn't support this exact statement, but version 3.10 released the `match` statement, which is very similar.
