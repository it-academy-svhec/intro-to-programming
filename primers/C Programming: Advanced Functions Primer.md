# Advanced Functions Primer
We use functions primarily to make our code reusable and more readable. Developers can write functions to solve difficult problems and then allow their teammates to use the functions without understanding the low-level implementation details. Functions also help make code more readable when named properly. For instance, a complex set of steps can be broken into many functions, each with a descriptive name and specific purpose.
