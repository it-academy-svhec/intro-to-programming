# Expressions and Operators Primer
Expressions, like in mathematics are combinations of operations and values that result in new values. For example, `1 + 1` is an expression in basic arithmetic that evaluates to the value of `2`. Expressions can also be combined together like `(1 + 1) * (2 * 3)`. First you evaluate each expression: `2 * 6`. Then you evaluate the new expression formed by the other two, which results in `12`. This systematic approach is also used to interpret expressions in programming languages.

## Operators and Operands
- **Operators:** symbols that perform operations with one or more values. `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` are the basic operators for arithmetic in C and many other languages
- **Operands:** the formal terms for the values used by operations. For example, consider `number1 + 5`. The addition operator is being used in combination with the operands of `number1` and `5`.
