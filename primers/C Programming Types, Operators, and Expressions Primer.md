# Types, Operators, and Expressions Primer

## Data types

Data is stored in memory as ones and zeroes. So whether you are storing a character for a letter grade or an integer for the number passed, the data is still binary. We use data types to indicate how we should handle stored binary information.

### Integers

The integer data type is used to store positive or negative whole numbers including zero. This data type is useful for storing information such as the number of days in a week or the quantity of a product in stock.

1. Create a REPL named **Types, Operators, and Expressions Primer**

2. Add the following code to define a main program and an integer variable named `days` to store the number of days in a week.

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main(void) {
   int days = 7;

   printf("Days in a week:\n");
   printf("%d", days);

   return 0;
   }
   ```
